# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge solution

This is a solution to the [Shortly URL shortening API Challenge challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
This is a basic URL shortening web application I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.  
The HTML file contains the complete structure for the application, including the navigation header, hero section, URL input form, feature cards, and footer, built with semantic elements and accessibility features to ensure it works well across different devices and for all users.  
The project allows users to input any valid URL, and it shortens the link using the Bitly API. I added input validation to make sure users enter proper URLs, and the app displays the shortened link right below the original one. Users can also copy the shortened URL to their clipboard by clicking a button. The design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes. This project helped me practice working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and handling user input in JavaScript. I also learned how to use asynchronous functions and improve user experience through simple interactions. Itâ€™s a small but useful tool that demonstrates how front-end development can connect with real-world services like Bitly.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
