# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge solution

This is a solution to the [Shortly URL shortening API Challenge challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
This is a basic URL shortening web application I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.  
The HTML file contains the complete structure for the application, including the navigation header, hero section, URL input form, feature cards, and footer, built with semantic elements and accessibility features to ensure it works well across different devices and for all users.  
The application allows users to input any valid URL and shortens it using the Bitly API. I implemented comprehensive input validation to ensure users enter proper URLs, with clear error messages and visual feedback. The app displays shortened links in a history section below the input, where users can easily copy URLs to their clipboard with a single click. Each copy action provides immediate visual feedback, changing the button text to "Copied!" for better user experience.
The design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes. This project helped me practice working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and handling user input in JavaScript. I also learned how to use asynchronous functions and improve user experience through simple interactions. Itâ€™s a small but useful tool that demonstrates how front-end development can connect with real-world services like Bitly.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
